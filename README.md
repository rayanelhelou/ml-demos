# ml-demos

This repository contains Machine Learning related demos, for educational purposes, written in Python and presented as notebook files (.ipynb). These files can be run either in Jupyter (Lab/Notebook) or online by uploading to Google Colab.



### How to use this repository

1. Download all the repo and place it in one directory.
2. If you already have all necessary Python packages set up, you may skip this step. Otherwise:
   * Read `python_setup.md`
   * If you choose to use Google Colab, simply "Upload Notebook" whichever .ipynb file to run online on Colab.
3. Open Jupyter Lab/Notebook in the same directory to access the notebooks of each folder.



### What's included

* In each folder (topic per folder)
  * A notebook (.ipynb) which can be viewed directly online, run in Jupyter Lab/Notebook or Google Colab.
  * Supplementary files used by the notebook (e.g. .csv time-series, or .py modules)
* `python_setup.md`
  * Details the one-time setup of Python & Jupyter, virtual environments, and package installations
  * Ensure that all packages are installed before running the notebooks in the folders
* `requirements.txt`
  * A supplementary file used in the procedures described in`python_setup.md`
  * Lists most of the Python packages needed
